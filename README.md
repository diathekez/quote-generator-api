# Quoth the Raven
A simple web app that retrieves random quotes from an API to allow users a moment of reflection.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, Node.js, Bulma

**Important:** You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. I used [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), so I recommend checking out the documentation if you're new to using CSS frameworks.

This app is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and the API comes from [this](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) Github repo.

## Optimizations

Because this was supposed to originally be just one section with the API results, I sort of just stuck the code in the App.js file along with the components in a rather disorganized way. In the future, I'll tidy up the code.

## Lessons Learned

This is a simple project that I did to learn how to consume APIs with React using Axios. I also learned a bit about useEffect and useState. Basic stuff.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
